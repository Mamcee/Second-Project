# Second-Project
This repository holds details of my second Odin project and the commit history of my codes.
My second project involved creating a landing page. I found it a bit easy to work on this project because of my previous experiences and progress on the course. It is obvious that you become conversant with your codes as you progress.
This project aimed to show my understanding of the almighty "FLEXBOX" principles and use cases.
The project was created using: HTML, and Css flexbox principles.
